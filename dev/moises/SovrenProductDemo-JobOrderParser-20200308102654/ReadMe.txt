Thank your for using the Sovren Product Demo for Job Parsing!

For each file that was uploaded, a folder with that file name has been created. Inside each file folder, you will find the following documents:
 - [FileName].json (The standard parsed document as JSON)
 - [FileName].xml (The standard parsed document as XML)
 - [FileName].html (The HTML representation of the document text. We also support outputting the document as PDF and RTF with a simple setting in the API request)
 - [FileName] (The original file that was uploaded)
