 <BR>
Project Details: Used quantitative data gathered to develop an understanding Customer segmentation. o analyzed the<BR>
content of an E-commerce database that lists purchases made by ?4000 customers over a period of one year. Based on this<BR>
analysis, I develop a model that allows to anticipate the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following<BR>

algorithms : Support vector machine,LogisticRegression,KNN,Decision Tree and Random Forest to accomplish the customer<BR>
segmentation. o Performance of the classifier therefore was correct given the potential shortcomings of the current model. o<BR>
75% of clients are awarded the right classes.<BR>
